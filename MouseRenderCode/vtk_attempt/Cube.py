# <VTK-root>/Examples/DataManipulation/Cxx/Cube.cxx from the VTK
# source distribution, which "shows how to manually create vtkPolyData"
#
# A convenience function, mkVtkIdList(), has been added and one if/else
# so the example also works in version 6 or later.

# Lines like `obj->Delete()` have been transliterated as `del obj` to,
# preserve the resemblance to the original C++ example, although I 
# doubt this achieves anything beyond what Python's garbage collection
# would do anyway.
